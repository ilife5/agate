The whole point is to split big task of generating entire HTML into many small tasks ( aka pagelets ). For example assume you want to send to a browser two things: user details and details of a transaction he just made. Instead of doing both these tasks ( ie loading data from DB ) and sending HTML after that, you would load a user from DB an send it to browser, then load transaction from DB and send it to browser.

This ultimetly leads to a better user experience and faster loading time ( because browser generates HTML chunk by chunk which is more efficient then everything at once ).

Note that this was developed ( or at least widely used by ) Facebook, so read this article for more info:
